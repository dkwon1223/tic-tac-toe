## Context
- This was a final project for Turing Mod 1
- Approximately 20 hours were alloted over a week to complete this project
- Learning goals for this project consisted of the following:
  - Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
DRY JavaScript
    - I believe I can definitely work on this more through practice, however I'm proud of the way I implemented game logic and functionality.
  - Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
    - This proved to be more difficult than expected without a data model provided to me like previous projects, however I managed to pull through and develop my own approach to the data model and displaying it on the DOM 
  - Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
    - I believe I used for loops extensively to iterate over DOM elements and the data model especially since I used an array
  - Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge
    - While I was extremely tempted to look up expert approaches or YouTube tutorials, I am proud that I stayed disciplined and struggled through to find my own approach through pseudocoding and research. The only external resources I used were MDN docs, Turing curriculum, my mentor, and Stack Overflow.

## Wins + Challenges

- Wins:
  - Stayed patient despite wanting to look up answers
  - Resorted to many failed approaches and research to ultimately come to a solution that worked throughout many iterations
  - Gained new confidence in approaching new unfamiliar concepts with the combination of asking for help, identifying essential resources, researching on MDN docs, and carefully, precisely crafted Google searches(which mostly lead to Stack Overflow and was extremely helpful/a good learning experience)
  - Stayed mindful of atomic commits and using branches to log and snapshot my progress
- Challenges:
  - Usually the CSS proves to be the pain in my ass, however I decided to keep it simple this time while moving my focus towards functionality
  - In terms of functionality, I found that it's much harder than it seems to build a project from scratch. From planning and deciding how to implement the data model, to modifying it and displaying it to the DOM, the process proved to be a different animal when doing it all on my own without Turing curriculum assistance(pre-provided arrays, styles, assets/icons)
    - Despite this, struggling through and building something on my own proved to be very rewarding and worth all the stress
